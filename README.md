# Password-Generation-Macro
VB Macro created to create test and randomly generated live passwords for online surveys

Previously at work, we had to manually create passwords which took a long time and was very repetitive so I decided to make a macro so all we have to do was provide the key information and it would automatically generate the password files to be uploaded and to be sent to respondents.
